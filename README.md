Fuzzy match from strings in a Stata dataset to an excel file

This program allows fuzzy matching from strings in a Stata dataset to 
    an excel file. It was based on an online tutorial, which I can no longer 
    find so at least some of the commands are not my creation. I used Florida's
    AHCA data and the SK&A dataset to match hospital names, but this should be 
    adaptable to multiple datasets.
